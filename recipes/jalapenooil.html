        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jalapeño infused olive oil is one of our favorite ways to use extra chilies at season’s end. You can then enjoy that chili pepper heat all winter long. It also makes a terrific homemade spicy food gift come the holiday season. Just package it up in a fancy bottle and voila!
